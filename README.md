# ToA-Dinosaur-Racing
This program simulates Port Nyanzaru's dinosaur racing, in the Dungeons and Dragons Tomb of Annihilation adventure.

The odds as written in the module work with the assumption that all players will bet on the same racer- this program will output the racers placed 1-9, determined based on the odds provided in the book.

There is a commented-out function which demonstrates the accuracy with which the adjusted odds for each racer match up with the odds provided in the book.
